# BlitzTTT Win Conditions
This addon changes the default win condition in Trouble in Terrorist Town in some interesting ways:  
- If the match time runs out, innocents win due to time limit.
- If only traitors are alive, traitors win.
- If all traitors are dead **and** their bodies are **all** confirmed, innocents win.
- If all traitors are dead but not confirmed dead and the last innocent dies, traitors win.

## Installation
Drop the `BlitzTTTWin_addon` folder in your `addons` folder.  
Done.
